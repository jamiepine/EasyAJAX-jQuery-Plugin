# EasyAJAX jQuery Plugin

An incredibly useful jQuery plugin to implement AJAX loading / form submission into any website or app, with full support for CSRF tokens. EasyAJAX uses HTML markup and tags to add AJAX to any link / form. 

Check out the **[demo](http://jamiepine.github.com/)** to see it in action!

### Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of jQuery installed and called before this plugin. Insert the following into your `<head>` tag, just like any other jQuery script.

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/jquery.easyajax.min.js"></script>
```
